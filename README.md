Internship Project: Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews

As an intern at CodTech IT Solutions, I successfully developed a sentiment analysis model to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative. This project showcases the expertise in natural language processing and the ability to create impactful solutions for text analysis tasks using advanced machine learning techniques.

Project Highlights:

Dataset and Preprocessing:

•	Used the IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset, a benchmark dataset for sentiment classification.

•	Focused on the 10,000 most frequent words to ensure computational efficiency.

•	Preprocessed the text data by padding sequences to a fixed length of 200 tokens, enabling uniformity for neural network input.



Model Development:

•	Built a sentiment classification model using a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture:

o	Embedding Layer: Captures word representations in a lower-dimensional vector space.

o	LSTM Layer: Handles sequential dependencies in the reviews for better context understanding.

o	Dense Output Layer: Classifies reviews into binary categories: positive or negative.

•	Compiled the model with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function, optimizing for classification accuracy.



Model Training and Evaluation:

•	Trained the model for 5 epochs using an 80-20 split of the training data for validation.

•	Achieved a high accuracy score, reflecting the model's effectiveness in sentiment prediction.
Evaluation Metrics and Results:

•	Generated a classification report with precision, recall, and F1-scores for both classes.

•	Created a confusion matrix to visualize the model's performance, highlighting accurate and misclassified predictions.
Visualizations:

•	Plotted a confusion matrix heatmap, providing a clear representation of prediction results.

•	Showcased example reviews with decoded text and corresponding predicted sentiments for qualitative analysis.
